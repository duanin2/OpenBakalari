     * Returns the relative amount that the wheel was rotated, in eighths of a degree.
     * A positive value indicates that the wheel was rotated forwards away from the user;
     * a negative value indicates that the wheel was rotated backwards toward the user.
     *
     * angleDelta().y() provides the angle through which the common vertical mouse wheel was
     * rotated since the previous event.
     * angleDelta().x() provides the angle through which the horizontal mouse wheel was
     * rotated, if the mouse has a horizontal wheel; otherwise it stays at zero.
     *
     * Some mice allow the user to tilt the wheel to perform horizontal scrolling,
     * and some touchpads support a horizontal scrolling gesture;
     * that will also appear in angleDelta().x().
     *
     * Most mouse types work in steps of 15 degrees,
     * in which case the delta value is a multiple of 120; i.e.,
     * 120 units * 1/8 = 15 degrees.
     *
     * However, some mice have finer-resolution wheels and
     * send delta values that are less than 120 units (less than 15 degrees).
     * To support this possibility, you can either cumulatively add the delta
     * values from events until the value of 120 is reached,
     * then scroll the widget, or you can partially scroll the widget in
     * response to each wheel event.
     *
     * But to provide a more native feel, you should prefer pixelDelta()
     * on platforms where it's available.
